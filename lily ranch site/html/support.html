        We are a small, self-sustaining business. All the proceeds go to keeping both the animals
        and workers at Lily Ranch safe and healthy. Most of the funds go to housing, food, warmth, and veterinary care. 
        Therefore we always appreciate help in many ways! Here are some ways you can help us:
